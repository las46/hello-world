# hello-world


I am learning Python and R. I have created a Github account to aid in my learning.

I have coded in the past but transitioned to project/program management. I am interested in Data Science, so I have begun taking training in Analytics, Python and R.

Feel free to follow my journey.

Best Regards,

Lou
